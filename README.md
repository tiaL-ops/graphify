# Maze Generator with Prim's Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project is a **maze generator** built using **React** that implements **Prim's Algorithm**. It generates random mazes and provides an interactive interface where users can explore the maze generation process and learn about the algorithm. (Including myself haha!)

### Features:
- **Random Maze Generation**: Generates unique mazes using Prim's Algorithm each time the game starts.
- **Regenerate Button**: Allows users to regenerate the maze with a new layout at any time.
- **Learning Mode**: Offers a sidebar or pop-up modal with a brief explanation of Prim's Algorithm and how it works in maze generation.
- **Interactive Grid**: Displays the maze with walls and paths, using clean visuals and responsive design.

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd maze-generator
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`, where you can explore the maze and regenerate it as needed.

### Technologies Used:
- **React**: Frontend framework for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Framer Motion** (Optional): For smooth animations of the maze and player movement.
- **CSS Grid**: For flexible and responsive layout of the maze grid.

### Future Improvements:
- Add different maze-solving algorithms (e.g., DFS, BFS).
- Improve animations for smoother user interaction.
- Add a scoring system or game mode.
