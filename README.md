# **Maze Generator & Graph Algorithms Learning Tool**

## **Project Overview**
This project is a **graph algorithms learning tool** built using React. It allows users to explore graph-based algorithms like **Prim's Algorithm**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** in an interactive environment. Through generating and solving mazes, users can visualize how these algorithms operate, making it a hands-on experience to deepen their understanding of core computer science concepts.

## **Features**
- **Random Maze Generation**: Uses various graph algorithms like Prim's Algorithm to generate unique mazes each time.
- **Interactive Learning**: Visualize how DFS and BFS work step-by-step as they traverse through the maze to find solutions.
- **Regenerate Button**: Quickly generate new mazes for a fresh challenge.
- **Learning Mode**: Provides explanations and visualizations of the graph algorithms in action, helping users grasp the mechanics behind them.

## **How to Run**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd maze-generator
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the maze and learn about graph algorithms.

## **Technologies Used**
- **React**: For building a dynamic and interactive interface.
- **CSS Grid**: To create the flexible and responsive maze layout.
- **Optional**: **Framer Motion** for smoother animations.

## **Learning Focus**
The primary goal of this project is to teach **graph traversal algorithms** in an intuitive way:
- **Prim's Algorithm**: Understand how it generates mazes by creating a minimum spanning tree.
- **DFS & BFS**: Explore how these algorithms navigate through the maze, highlighting their different approaches to graph traversal.

## **Future Improvements**
- Add more graph algorithms like **A* Search** or **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**.
- Improve animations and user interactivity for a smoother experience.
- Incorporate a game mode with a scoring system based on user performance.
